# Monthly Evaluation Client Project "helpchen"

**Mrs. Chen Yong, your client from China is having issues on GitHub, you are to create this repository helpchen and write the guidelines on:**

*How to install git on a local machine (git.txt)

*Create a GitHub account and clone repos to the local machine (github.txt)

*Write 20 git commands and their functions (git_commands.txt)

# This the following files have been created to assist Mrs. Chen Yung...

The git.txt file explains the first step to take which is to install git (git bash)... Of course to confirm the installation one will need to type *git --version* in the cmd or so...

Moving yo the next step, Mrs. Yung will need an account on github and then a repo to enhance practices. This information is found in the file *github.com*

Lastly, in order to work on git Mrs Yung will need to be familiar with at least 20 git commands. The last file deals with that...!
